Create a full, modern, and responsive artist website for a music performer named **Andhray**. All code must be placed inside a single file named `index.html`. Use clean HTML5, embedded CSS (inside <style>), and JavaScript (inside <script>). Do not use external CSS or JS files. All styles, scripts, and content must be in the same file.

Take strong inspiration from https://amelielens.com/ in terms of structure, layout, and design style. The final result should feel premium, minimalist, and visually professional.

The website must include the following key features:

1. **Biography Section** – A stylish section introducing Andhray and her background as a music artist.

2. **Upcoming Music Releases** – Display a list or card-style layout of upcoming tracks, albums, or EPs.

3. **Featured Videos** – A gallery or section that embeds important music videos or live performances.

4. **Photo and Video Gallery** – A grid-based downloadable gallery of high-resolution images and videos.

5. **Upcoming Events** – A section that shows future concerts or performances, with:
   - Event name
   - Date and location
   - Ticket link for each event

6. **Editable Links Area** – A section that allows the artist or admin to easily update/add external links (to music platforms, interviews, or partners).

7. **Important Milestones** – Timeline or highlighted events that showcase career achievements.

8. **Social Media Integration** – Include visible, stylish icons linking to Andhray’s social platforms (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Spotify, etc.).

9. **Booking Request Form** – A fully functional automated booking section where visitors can:
   - Select a desired event date via calendar picker
   - Submit their:
     - Full name
     - Email address
     - Phone number
     - Country
     - City where the event will be held
     - Event proposal or description

   Upon submission, the form should notify booking agents for follow-up. No backend is required, but provide placeholders for future integration (e.g., with Google Sheets or APIs).

10. **Multilingual Support** – The entire website must be translatable into:
   - English
   - Spanish
   - Italian
   - German
   - Portuguese
   - Chinese (Simplified)

   Include a language switcher dropdown in the top-right corner, and allow automatic switching of all visible text. Use a lightweight JS solution or provide inline translation logic using data attributes.

11. **Project Section: “Industrial Girls”** – Add a dedicated section for Andhray’s record label *Industrial Girls*:
   - Brief description and mission
   - Showcase of associated projects, releases, or collaborators
   - Embed any related videos or social links

12. **AI-Powered Automation (structure only)** – Include placeholders or basic automation logic for:
   - Capturing user data (with consent)
   - Sending email updates for new music releases
   - Preparing collected data for advertising segmentation

13. **Color Palette** – Use the following brand colors:
   - **Red** (#E53935) – primary action buttons and highlights
   - **Orange** (#FB8C00) – accents and interactive elements
   - **Yellow** (#FDD835) – emphasis and hover states
   - **White** (#FFFFFF) – background and clean space

14. **Responsive Design** – The entire page must look perfect on both desktop and mobile. Use flexbox/grid layouts, modern fonts (like Poppins or Roboto), and smooth animations.

15. **Accessibility & SEO** – Use semantic HTML, proper <meta> tags, descriptive alt text, and a responsive layout for optimal accessibility and search engine visibility.

16. **Editable & Expandable** – Structure the HTML and JS code so it can be easily updated by the artist or team. Add placeholder comments where images, videos, and PDFs will be added later.

Generate the complete `index.html` file now with all structure, styles, and logic included. Do not include any additional files or README. Everything must be self-contained and ready to preview.
